# Singly Linked List
A linked list is a sequence of data elements, which are connected together via links. Each data element contains a connection to another data element in form of a pointer.

## Challenge
Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the Node, and a pointer to the next Node.
Create a linked list class that can add a new node with that value to the head of the list with an O(1) Time performance. Indicate whether that value exists as a Nodeâ€™s value somewhere within the list.
Returns: a string representing all the values in the Linked List

## Approach & Efficiency
Big O for space and time are O(n)
